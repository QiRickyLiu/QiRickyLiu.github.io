### PhD project

The topic of my PhD focus on the interactions of physical, biological and geochemical processes in a complex dynamic system. I deploy high-resolution microsensors to collect data in situ then input it into SOTA mechanictic model and date-driven model, finally output prediction under different future scenarios to enhance our understanding for global enviromnetal change.
