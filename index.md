### Research interests: 
1. From a methodological and theoretical perspective

a.coupling of physical and biological model
To couple different physical fields and biological processes is needed in many scenarios. Under this topic, the one that interests me mostly is to incorporate physical(temperature, irradiance, hydrodynamic) factors to simulate the life activities(photosynthesis, respiration, nutrient absorption, trophic coupled, vertical immigration) in sediment-water interface system to predict their environmental effects(biogeochemical cycles). The reason why I found this work interesting is that it involves physics, chemistry, biology and use mathematical and computer science tools —— which is perfect for a young man who is devoted to all science domains and don't know which specific to study!

b.the combination of mechanistic model and machine learning
I believe that true science has to be explainable, which means we have to figure out the mechanism behind the phenomenon, not only find the correlation. And these are usually in the form of partial differencial equation(PDE). In other words, we use PDEs to describe the function of how state variables vary with time, space and other variables, which are usually clear physical or chemical laws. Data from experiment or field observations provide parameters, new formulas and calibration/validation. However, the rapid development of artificial intelligence methods also show great power in predicting future situations, especially we are living in a world full of data. To combine physics-based model and data-driven model can be exciting work.

c.emergence and swarm intelligence in complex systems
Multi-agents work as a whole and exhibit capability that's almost impossible as an individual——isn't it amazing! This topic can not only provide inspirations for the origin of life, but also have significance for bionic areas like robotics. The modelling system I concentrate on is microbiology system (like biofilms), which functions as a whole and even can be seen as some kind of new individual life! The approaches can be Agent-based model(ABM) and other algorithms. 

2.From a applied and engineering perspective

a.establishing artificial biosystem
Inventing life is God's work, but guess what? God also give human the intelligence that's unique among all the life forms! That's why scientists and engineers try to "design" cell like electric circuit to make it produce what we need or even work as computing tool to solve problems. The most promising field is to establish and optimize artificial ecosystem to yield biofuels or medicine that are highly demanded by human society. This is also somewhere we can see the power of mathematical modeling and computer science for biology.

b.swarm-robots
Once we get inspiration from emergence and complexity of life systems, we can apply these principles to design swarm robots. The most promising prospect is to send them into human bodies to destroy cancer cells or transport medicine accurately. Of course to degrade environmental pollutants is also super cool!


### skill sets
scientific computing; numerical modeling; software development

### PhD project

The topic of my PhD focus on the interactions of physical, biological and geochemical processes in a complex dynamic system. I deploy high-resolution microsensors to collect data in situ then input it into SOTA numerical model and date-driven model, finally output prediction under different future scenarios to enhance our understanding for global enviromnetal change.
