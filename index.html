### Research interests: 
1.From a methodological and theoretical perspective

a.coupling of physical and biological model
To couple different physical fields and biological processes is needed in many scenarios. Under this topic, the one that interests me mostly is to incorporate physical(temperature, irradiance, hydrodynamic) factors to simulate the life activities(photosynthesis, respiration, nutrient absorption, trophic coupled, vertical immigration) in sediment-water interface system to predict their environmental effects(biogeochemical cycles). The reason why I found this work interesting is that it involves physics, chemistry, biology and use mathematical and computer science tools —— which is perfect for a young man who is devoted to all science domains and don't know which specific to study!

b.the combination of mechanistic model and machine learning
I believe that true science has to be explainable, which means we have to figure out the mechanism behind the phenomenon, not only find the correlation. And these are usually in the form of partial differencial equation(PDE). In other words, we use PDEs to describe the function of how state variables vary with time, space and other variables, which are usually clear physical or chemical laws. Data from experiment or field observations provide parameters, new formulas and calibration/validation. However, the rapid development of artificial intelligence methods also show great power in predicting future situations, especially we are living in a world full of data. To combine physics-based model and data-driven model can be exciting work.

2.From a applied and engineering perspective

a.understanding natural ecosystem

b.establishing artificial biosystem
Inventing life is God's work, but guess what? God also give human the intelligence that's unique among all the life forms! That's why scientists and engineers try to "design" cell like electric circuit to make it produce what we need or even work as computing tool to solve problems. The most promising field is to establish and optimize artificial ecosystem to yield biofuels or medicine that are highly demanded by human society. This is also somewhere we can see the power of mathematical modeling and computer science for biology.

*1.How do the variations of water and sediment fluxes into the estuary influence the ecosystem? Yujun Yi, Qi Liu, Jin Zhang, Shanghong Zhang. Journal of Hydrology,Volume 600,2021,126523,ISSN 0022-1694,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126523.

Plain-language abstract:Fluctuations in hydrological signals (sediment fluxes into ocean) have a significant impact on estuarine ecosystems. The lack of methods for assessing the impact of fluctuations in hydrological signals on ecosystems limits ecosystem management. Therefore, it is of great significance to find a quantitative method for the analysis of estuarine ecosystem for the fluctuation of estuary hydrological signals. Based on long time series data, we aim to determine the dynamic responses of fish communities to changes in hydrological signals at different time scales, providing a new approach for the regulation of water and sediment processes in dam rivers. We established a functional regression model and improved the explicable functional linear regression (FLiRTI) method to quantify the dynamic response relationship between annual catch per unit effort (CPUE) and daily water and sediment flux in the Yellow River Estuary in the past 30 years. In this study, for the first time, data-driven predictive modeling was applied to ecohydraulics, overcoming the limitations of traditional model methods on the number of species and the inconsistency of hydroecological data on time scales.

*2.Response of trophic structure and isotopic niches of the food web to flow regime in the Yellow River estuary. Qi Liu, Yujun Yi, Chuanying Hou, Xuefei Wu, Jie Song. Marine Geology,Volume 430,2020,106329,ISSN 0025-3227,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.margeo.2020.106329.

Plain-language abstract:Changes in flow patterns lead to changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of nutrients entering the estuary area from the river, resulting in corresponding changes in the nutrient structure of the estuarine food web, and ultimately affect the entire Marine ecosystem. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the response of estuarine food web to changes in upstream hydrological conditions. In this study, a Bayesian statistical model was established on the R platform, and five quantified community indicators were extracted from the data to describe the nutrient structure pattern of the Yellow River estuary ecosystem at different times and in different locations. Bayesian methods are used to generate a posterior distribution of indicator estimates, providing an unbiased and more robust indicator of changes in population size and allowing statistical comparisons across regions and time periods. Provide uncertainty measures for these indicators describing different communities and compare them according to confidence intervals. The degree of overlap between Bayesian distributions is used as an indicator of similarity or dissimilarity between places and time periods. Our study shows that the nutrient structure patterns of estuarine ecosystems change with changes in hydrological conditions and environmental conditions, which greatly affects the stability of estuarine ecosystems.

## In review
*1.Runoff from upstream changes the structure and energy flow of food web in estuary. Qi Liu; Yujun Yi; Fanxuan Zhao; Jie Song. Submitted to Water Resources Research.

Plain-language abstract:This paper focuses on the influence of hydrological conditions on the structure and energy flow of estuarine food web. At the same time, the spatial heterogeneity of estuarine hydrological status and environmental conditions was considered, which filled the gap in the quantitative evaluation of energy flow of estuarine ecosystem affected by land runoff and ocean tides simultaneously. In this study, MixSIAR, a scripted version of the Bayesian mixing model, was used to calculate the relative contributions of food sources under different spatio-temporal conditions, taking into account the uncertainty, classification and continuous variables of the underlying food sources and nutrient abundance factors, as well as prior information. The distribution of the contribution of food sources to a consumer's diet is generated using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Five topological indexes are used to describe the structural characteristics of food web: node number (S), that is, the number of elements in the food web; Link (L), which represents the number of valid links in the food web; Maximum number of links (Max. L), which represents the maximum number of possible links in the food web; Link density (D), i.e., number of links/species; And connections (C), which is the number of valid links/maximum number of possible links (Pimm et al., 1991).

*2.Predict the estuarine ecosystem stability with a coupled hydrodynamic-food web model. Qi Liu, Yujun Yi, Xuefei Wu, Wenfei Jia, Yanning Gao. Submitted to Limnology and Oceanography.

Plain-language abstract:Based on our previous statistical analysis of data-driven models and ecological data, the stability of the food web is strongly influenced by upstream hydrological sequences, but machine learning and statistical methods cannot provide a mechanistic understanding that can be extrapolated to future scenarios. In this study, the framework for aquatic biogeochemical modeling (FABM) was used to combine the fvcom unstructured grid hydrodynamic model and the ERSEM ecosystem dynamics model to construct the hydrodynamic and ecosystem dynamics coupling modelin the study area. The Jacobi matrix was established by using the ecological community index based on isotope data in the previous study. The eigenvalues of the matrix were used to represent the stability of the food web, and the response of the stability of the target system under the hydrological sequence of different engineering control schemes was simulated.

## At work
*1.Mechanical modeling provides insights into intertidal sediment temperature responses to global heat waves

Short introduction:Temperature has a great influence on the rate of physiological and biochemical reactions of organisms in the earth system. Recently more and more extreme weather such as heat waves are threatening natural ecosystems. The thermodynamic properties of water and sediment in Marine ecosystem are different, and the heat exchange mechanism between the two phases is very complicated due to the changes of irradiance, tidal inundation and other conditions. The aim of this study is to establish a two-dimensional numerical model of water-sediment system to simulate the response of water-sediment temperature to changes in external physical conditions.

*2.Coupling temperature physical model and microbial physiological model to simulate the effects of global warming on ocean oxygen cycle

Short introduction:We set up micro-sensors to capture the rate data of microbial physiological and biochemical reactions in the natural environment, and further designed experiments to obtain more parameters under temperature conditions. On this basis, we established a mathematical model of microbial photosynthesis and respiration. Coupled with the temperature physical model established in the previous study, we can gain more insight into how temperature affects the physiological and biochemical reactions of microorganisms and thus the elemental cycles in nature, and make more accurate predictions of biogeochemical responses to future scenarios of extreme weather.
